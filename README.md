### Metallic and Smoothness Map Merger
A convenient tool for Unity to automatically merge smoothness/roughness maps into the alpha channel of a metallic map

Made for use with shaders such as Unity's Standard shader, which only accept one map

- One-click button to merge metallic and smoothness/roughness maps into one
- Works with different sized textures (automatically scales to larger size)
- "Invert" button for use with roughness maps
- Automatically generates new image in same location as metallic map

**Usage Instructions:**
- Select "Metallic and Smoothness Merger" under "Loki" at the top of the Unity Window
- Drag your metallic and smoothness/roughness maps into their respective slots
- If using a roughness map, toggle the "Invert Smoothness Map" checkbox
- Click "Merge"
- Locate your newly made map in the same location as your old metallic map
